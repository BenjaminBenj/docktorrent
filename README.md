# docktorrent

Using Docker, rTorrent and ruTorrent to run a full-featured BitTorrent box.

## Quick Start

Build the image yourself:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kfei/docktorrent
docker build -t docktorrent
```

On a slow machine, you can just pull a pre-built image:
```bash
docker pull kfei/docktorrent
```
